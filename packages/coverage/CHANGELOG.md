## [UNRELEASED] - 2020-08-25

This project got a major overhaul, with several updates to the tooling, including packages renaming and retiring some scripts. Below is a breakdown by package.

**Breaking changes**

- Renamed package `@ethereumjs/config-nyc` => [`@ethereumjs/config-coverage`](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-config/tree/master/packages/coverage)
- The platform-specific script `ethereumjs-config-coveralls` got removed, due to the use of Codecov and [nicer integration to GitHub CI](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action).
